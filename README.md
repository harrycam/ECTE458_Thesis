# ECTE458 Thesis

This is the GitHub repository for my ECTE458 Thesis project. It includes all the simulation and hardware code used in the project.

## Software Folder

Contains the code for the SRL and Dual Objective controller in MATLAB. Also contains the code to back distill the control policies of the SRL controller onto the original Expert FLC.

## Hardware Folder

Contains the Thymio Aseba code for autonomous navigation through the FLC. It also contains the code to localise the robot in MATLAB via a webcam feed and send this data to the robot.
